						Hi, I am Dmytro Bogatov, and thank you for visiting my blog!
					</div>
					<p>
						I am a student at WPI on a Computer Science undergraduate program. My primary interests are Web-development and Data Science. I have started programming in 2010 and I am gradually mastering this skill since then. So far I have had 2 part-time and 1 full-time jobs. I am also considering applying to CS graduate school in the US.
